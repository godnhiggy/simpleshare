# simpleshare
An initial app effort that combines two thoughts into a simple user interface.
1."Video" creation through the use of HTML/CSS transition/animation
2. Email/Text Message contact list 
Combining these two thoughts allows the user to target an audience with their thoughts and products in a unique way.

This project has multiple purploses, all of which is for my own growth in the following areas.
  a. To develop a functional app that can genuinely help others.
  b. To develop my personal programming skills (I have an exciting journey ahead.... :] )
  c. To develop my teaching skills for my high school Computer Science program
  
  The functionality of the app is very limited as of the original push.
Possible future features:
  a. personalizing the videos to individuals within the group that the video is sent to
  b. organizing contacts into readily identifiable and choosable "permanent" groups
  c. finding a way to automatically search, find and choose from public information phone service providers for the text messaging feature(a very sticky issue)
  d. building on a platform where database construction can be from sql/mysql from within the app instead of through cpanel(limited because of shared hosting 
  on bluehost?) possible solution -> digitialocean?
  e. limiting number of rows delivered and/or rendered to 4 in current video template
  f. create many templates for video content delivery
  g. brainstorm/create sysem where user is informed when video was watched, by whom
  h. brainstorm/create a system of response/interaction between deliverer and recipient of videos
  i. focus on app aesthetics for mobile users
  j. prospect uses of app
  k. prospect users of app for vetting process
  l. prospect monetizing ideas if feasible
  m. encourage development ideas from others
